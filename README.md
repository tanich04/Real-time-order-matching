This is a forked project I explored to understand the fundamentals of building real-time trading systems.

### Key Takeaways & Contributions:
- Learned core concepts behind real-time order matching engines and financial exchanges.
- Understood matching algorithms and handling of different order types like Limit, Market, IOC, etc.
- Will be integrating this backend with a lightweight frontend to simulate prediction markets or gaming platforms (inspired by Probo).
